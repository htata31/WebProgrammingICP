        <h3>Episode1:</h3>
        <p>
            Cameron’s brother Jonathan Black is revealed to the world in the worst possible way: blamed for a
                death in a car accident. However, Jonathan knows he was framed, as the supposed victim was
                heterochromatic while the actual victim was not. One year later, a plane containing a drug lord in a
                hangar appears to explode under FBI custody. However, Cameron realizes that it was an illusion and that
                the plane was dragged out from the back of the hangar. Cameron makes a deal with FBI agent Kay Daniels:
                he [with his magic team] will help the FBI find and catch the drug lord in exchange for the FBI's help
                in clearing Jonathan’s name. After catching the drug lord, Kay finds a phone at the hangar. Cameron
                finds that the person who helped make the plane disappear is the same mystery woman that framed
                Jonathan. <br>
